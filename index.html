His glittering career started when he became the only companion of Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland in Cast Away (2000). Many say this is Wilson's best performance and he couldn't have given a better effort. He has made notable guest appearances on shows like Family Guy (1999), where he was able to poke fun at his role in Cast Away."
